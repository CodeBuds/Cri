# Cri
###Chrome Graphical Interface
#####Developed by David Smerkous and Eli smith
This is a *very* capable tool that utilizes the tool Crouton built and designed for chromebooks<br>
It is required to have the app <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crouton-integration/gcpneefbbnfalgjniomfjknbcgkbijom" target="_new">Crouton integration</a> for anything to work.<br>
This interface is a chrome end application to install and run Ubuntu applications without the need<br>
to run a seperate instance of Crouton/Ubuntu in the background or have it dual mounted.<br>
This saves power and time with the ease of access we provide with this tool for Chrome OS <br>
